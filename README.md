# Beer consumption with statsmodels and scikit-learn combined

Hello, everyone!

I'm leaving this space to be the repo of the analysis I wrote on the following link to my Medium Article.

At this time, I tried to build a framework of how can we use `stasmodels` and `scikit-learn` combined to extract the best regularized model for a simple regression task.

The code is provided in the jupyter file uploaded in this repo. Check it out! :)
